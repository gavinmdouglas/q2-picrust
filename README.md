# q2-picrust

This repo contains the plugin to run PICRUSt in QIIME 2 environment. This is mainly a placeholder until PICRUSt is ported to python 3, can deal with DADA2 output, etc.  
  
This plugin is currently under development and currently only the normalize-by-copy-number and predict-metagenomes wrappers are working.
